    <p id="para1">MobileNet is a type of convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision
        applications.
        They are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight
        deep neural networks that can have low latency for mobile and embedded devices.

    <p id="para2">Google Lens lets you search what you see. Using a photo, your camera or almost any image,
        Lens helps you discover visually similar images and related content, gathering results from all over
        the internet.Google Lens is an image recognition technology developed by Google, designed to bring up
        relevant information related to objects it identifies using visual analysis based on a neural network. </p>
